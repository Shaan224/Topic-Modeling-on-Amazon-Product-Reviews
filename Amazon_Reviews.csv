Bluetooth doesn't work
",7 October 2019,"
Mivi thunder beats doesn't connect to my phone. My phone model is redmi note 4.Although I ordered one of these earlier and that product doesn't connect to my phone. At the time I thought that it was defective. So I replaced the first order. After getting this product the same problem still happens.So I request to me please call me and solve this problem.

Value for money wireless earphones!!
",7 October 2019,"
I got these ThunderBeats for Rs.999, At this price point these are the best wireless earphones you can go for.->gave me about 6-7 hours of battery backup when used at volume levels less than 75% and I should say these are pretty loud earphones, so definitely you never going to listen to music at 100% volume for long time.->These connect very quickly to your device, thanks for Bluetooth 5.0 it really makes difference->Range is about 10-15 feet when the devices are at line of sight. When you are indoor it works seamlessly if you are in next room but if there are 2 walls in between the source and earphones it starts breaking.->I like the Design and built quality of ThunderBeats->If you are a bass-head, you may not love it but you will like it.I will definitely recommend these  earphones at this price point.Note: I got these without case

Bang for the buck! | Value for money.
",24 October 2019,"
I purchased the Mivi Thunderbeats during the sale for just ₹999, making it an incredible deal.Having used them for almost 2 weeks now, here's what I think about the product.Build Quality: The earphones are cased in metal, have flat tangle-free wires & very good quality ear tips and earfins. So, for the price, the build great. Rough usage won't be a problem as well.Sound quality: The bass is really punchy. If you like EDMs, you'll love these earphones. The mids felt a little muffled and the treble could've been just a bit better, but for the price, the is little room for complaint. Overall sound quality is enjoyable and really good for wireless earphones under ₹1,500.Comfort: The earbuds feel a little heavy because of the metal casing, so comfort is compromised a bit. Although you can wear it for an hour or so without any worries, beyond that you might feel a little uncomfortable. It's not bad, but definitely could've been better.Pros:1. Good build quality2. Decent sound quality3. Good mic quality.4. Ipx4 water resistant.5. Best for sports.6. Magnetic earbuds.Cons:1. Not very comfortable.2. No case provided.Overall, if you're getting them for a good price and you're a fan of bass, I believe, you won't regret this purchase.You can watch my detailed unbiased review on my channel, Unwrap Impulse on YouTube.

Mohit Nautiyal,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
Great product at 1000/- INR, But not meant for PUBG.
",17 October 2019,"
Let's talk the cons first, as they are very few.Cons:1. They don't support any Qualcomm aptX version (and honestly no other Bluetooth earphones would have this technology at this price point). But just be aware that it doesn't have it as some answers in the product listing falsely claim it to be having it.IMPACT: Not great for gaming usage (significant ~1second audio delay when playing online shooter multiplayer games such as PUBG mobile, COD, etc.)2. It could be a personal opinion, but I couldn't use them for more than 40-45 minutes. My cartilage starts to pain with any usage exceeding that time. (Tried all combos of ear hooks and earpiece).EDIT#1: With time, it seems my ear is getting used to it and now the continuous usage time extends to around 90 mins. which is decent. Anyway, it is recommended to remove earpiece for at least a minute once every 60 mins. (read somewhere, don't believe blindly :) ) to prevent damage to the ear from long term use.3. The outer casing of the earpiece is umm... LARGE for a Bluetooth earphone. It could work for some, but not for others. Again, a personal opinion.4. Some background static noise is always present during playback. You can notice this when you stop music playback, the static continues in the background until next 30-40 seconds and then it stops.Pros:1. Great sound quality. Can beat products from many big brands.2. Includes magnetic locks on ear tips. Just lock them around your neck when not plugged into the ear.3. Decent battery backup.4. Lightweight and compact (except the large eartips I talked about earlier in the review).5. Quickly connects6. It features Qualcomm cVc (Clear Voice Capture) and it works GREAT. You wouldn't notice it, BUT the people you are calling definitely would. It filters the background noise captured from your mic and the other party hears a crystal clear voice over the call.7. With all the above pros and at a meagre price tag of 1000/- INR during the sale, it offers a great value for money.Conclusion:-->BUY: Any usage NOT requiring real-time response such as listening to music, calling, video calling, etc.DON'T BUY: Gamers wanting an almost real-time response.The recent surge in demand for Bluetooth earphones arises mostly from the people buying smartphones which lack a standard 3.5mm jack (eg. OnePlus 6T and above, iPhone, etc).

Awesome experience go for itThe Mivi Thunderbeats is a decent entry-level Bluetooth headset. For Rs.999 it offers decent quality sound output, along with support for aptX which is rare at this price point. The design allows you to mix and match ear hooks and ear tips, and the magnets help a lot when in use and for storage. You can wear this headset for long durations and it can also be used while working out. While we would have preferred a more neutral sound signature, a lot of people do like exaggerated bass. If this works for you, the Mivi Thunderbeats offers good value for money.Pros:-1.Support for aptX codec2.In-line audio controls3.Magnetic earpieces

Mivi Thunder beats Bluetooth headphones review
",5 October 2019,"
Bought this product during the Amazon sale. Superb value for money product.Tested this product during my morning run, the earphones didn't disappoint me. The connectivity, sound quality and noise cancellation works perfectly. The bass is decent not too loud. The supporting clips is very during the run. I have tried other blue tooth headphones in this price range but the earplugs tend to fall off during the run or workout. Overall it is a great product.

Overall the earphones
",9 October 2019,"
1. SOUND- the sound of earphones is crystal clear so is the bass, The base of the earphones is amazing and it makes the listening experience whole lot experience. These earphones are perfect for gym due to extremely heavy base and sound.2. QUALITY- The quality of earphones is good they say them to be waterproof but some spills of water on my headset and that was the reason it was spoiled.3. FIT- Because of the hooks and its adjustable size and adjustable size of earbuds they give you an amazing sound experience. I wear them while running and gymming and they never come out of the ear they are so well fitted and good.

",3 October 2019,"
I was pleasantly surprised at how good the sound quality is. Got it on Amazon sale for 999, totally a steal!The battery backup is pretty awesome too and so is the Bluetooth connectivity, didn't have any issues pairing. The best part is that the bass isn't too overwhelming, like those mid range ones which have the bass amplified. It's pretty balanced.

Nice Bluetooth headphones!!
",18 October 2019,"
Not a professional reviewer, personally I think. Amazing grab for me during great Indian festival, the item is amazing in every sense and it's durable too. Bluetooth connectivity area range is okay we cannot expect more than 13 to 15 meters, I took it mainly for music and gaming  but in gaming I found a little lag in real time sound also I didn't knew Bluetooth devices may interfere latency of my phone while gaming.  Great for jogging, exercising, workout, music and all but not recommended if you are planning to use it while riding, because of amazing  noise cancellation of this headset we cannot fully concentrate on road. Great headset in the segment.

BETTER THAN THE BEST IN CURRENT WORLD.
",12 October 2019,"
The best affordable wireless earphones on Earth right now. The ThunderBeats deliver a snug fit and a well-balanced, fun and energetic sound. There's decent warmth and depth in the bass, topped with a clear and crisp midrange. The build quality adds another cream in the cake. They serve up a musical and entertaining performance, overflowing with energy and detail and high sound quality. They offer a more discreet listening experience, while their snug fit tends to deliver decent levels of isolation from the outside world for noise cancellation. A sensational pair of in-ear headphones.

The bass of this earphone is balanced not too much overpowering the highs and lows. Highs and lows are crystal clear. Battery backup is good.enough for my type of usage.

All in all, it's budget friendly product with simple functions. So it's worth to buy.
",13 October 2019,"
Firstly, if the connectivity is concerned it's quite good. Secondly, the bass is amazing and the modulation is up to the mark. As far as if it is evaluated on the basis of price, I would strongly recommend this headphones not only due to its good battery life but also the build quality seems realible enough. However, an improvisation could be done by making it waterproof along with little bit of increment in monetary value.

Sound quality is very good. I have used few other bluetooth earphones but this is best at this range. Bass quality is amazing. I have not used much still so I can't really comment on battery life but with whatever I used, I got 6+ hours of time with 80% volume.Only con is, this Bluetooth earphones are little heavy but you will use to it as you use regularly.

Great features at an amazing price. Though a little bit bulkier and feels pain.
",16 November 2019,"
Though noise cancellation and bass can be better, but not at this price point.It feels a bit bulkier, but is tolerable. You have to compromise somewhere if you are targeting this price point. Other than that amazing earphones. Kudos to Amazon for delivering it in less than 2 hours, without any packaging and simultaneously keeping even the outer plastic covering scratch free.Edit:- After using for two-three hours continuously, one can feel pain in the ears.

Decent bluetooth earphones.
",4 January 2020,"
I bought it for Rs. 1299 under some lightning deal.There are bluetooth earphones.Pros-1. Great sound quality.2. Wire quality is good.3. There is a wire-lock mechanism which is good. It helps in reducing the cable length which further helps in keeping the product tangle-free.4. Noise-cancellation is good.5. There are large magnets on the backside of both the earbuds. It is really helpful while you are not using these. These help keeping the earphone around your neck.6. Cheap.Cons-1. The size of the magnets is way too large. Not good-looking.2. Because of the large size of the magnets, the ear-buds have become quite large. Hence they come out of ears quite easily. Very bad.3. The button panel provided is of very cheap quality.4. The wire length is small. It should have been somewhat more.5. Not suitable for running. The earbuds come out as soon as you start running. Also not suitable for the gym. Really bad.Final comment- If you are low on budget, these earphones are just fine. If you don't have a very tight budget issue, go for Realme Bluetooth buds. Those are better valued for money. I won't recommend Mivi Bluetooth earphones if you don't have a big issue of budget.Update- It has not been even 1 month and the earphone stopped working. Garbage.I would recommend not to purchase it at all. Worst earphone.

I got a piece which was not looking as a new piece in any condition and after just an hour of usage it's buttons doesn't work and the way it was sent in packing it was not at all even looking it was straight from the manufacturer! There was no taper seal or seal on the product box, everything in the box are mispaced . Later i got replacement and the same with respect to the box and things inside it , the second one much worse, only one ear piece was working so had to ask for a refund , don't waste your money and time on this product!

Ear pains after half hour usage and very low microphone volume ( close to absent )
",27 December 2019,"
The sound quality was decent, didn't get time to explore battery life as it was quite painful to wear for more than 10 mins even after trying every possible earbud combo. Microphone volume during calls was horrible and at times it auto disconnected and connected. Constant beeping while playing music. Even cancelled calls on its own a few times.

Best Wireless Earphone Under 1500rs!!
",20 January 2020,"
Here's my review after using it for 15 days:Drivers-Yeah, the driver is big but it justified. It has pretty good bass and the sound quality is crisp.Bluetooth Range-Coming to the Bluetooth range. The range is perfect for people living in a 2bhk house. The average range is about around 40 feet or 12 metres. The range is great within 2 rooms. You can keep your phone within two rooms and roam around.Control panel-The control panel fine. There’s the volume up and down buttons and a home button for switching it on and off and also activate google assistance. It’s that simple. I wish the control panel was a bit lower because to change volume, the earbud most of the time fallsMusic Quality-The background music will be louder than the vocals. But, after listening to a lot of pop and electronic music, I really didn't feel the bass. The songs are little but music heavy but the vocals are clear. Not the best but for general people it's okay.Call Quality-The call quality is good. Look if your normal call quality through the phone is bad then you can’t expect a good call quality through this earphone. I have used it thoroughly and the voice was loud and clear and the caller was also able to hear my voice clearly. If you want to watch YouTube videos, listen to music just to pass time then it's a great deal! Go for it. The microphone is also great and quickly picks up your audio without any background noise.Charging and battery life-I am using the 18-watt OPPO VOOC 3.0 charger and man the charging speed is mind-blowing. It took only 15 mins to charge from 40 to 90.The battery life is really - good on this. It will easily last for 6 to 9 hours in 60 per cent volume. Here are some screenshots. I have used nonstop in minimum volume and I was blown away by the battery life.Comfort and Ease of Use-Better than wired earphones because wired earphones often get tangled and it’s a mess. Generally, for me, it took less than an hour to configure the right ear tips and wingtips. First, for some days it will be very uncomfortable. But, after two to three days, you will like it. The drivers are bit oversized which makes it heavy so without the right pair of the wingtip, the earphone may fall from your ear.Pros- If you want to watch YouTube videos, listen to music just to pass time then it's a great deal! Go for it.- The audio quality is not too bad not too good - somewhere in the middle, it's average. Worth going for it.- It has magnets on top of the ear buds that cling to each other.- The wing tips and earbuds are soft and comfortable.- The earphone is sweat resistant and will not fall from your ear while working out.- Bluetooth range and sound quality is top notch, I fell in love with it!- Say NO to tangled wire and 3.5 mm headphone jack.- You can connect it to TV, Laptop, tablet and smartphones. Works on both Android & iOS.- Battery life is around 7 to 9 hours on 60 percent volume. Charging time with normal mobile charger is 45 mins to 1 hr and with fast charger it is actually just under 20 minutes!!!Cons- Now, if you are serious about what you are listening to, if you want to feel the bass, want to listen to vocals clearly, then it's not for you.- The driver size is big. So you may feel uncomfortable after weeks.- No pouch or carry bag will be provided (Although you can carry it around your neck, but still..)That's my review and if you want to purchase it - don't think - BUY it now!

POOR BATTERY BACKUP..POOR QUALITY SOUND
",29 January 2020,"
Poor quality product. Only good thing is build quality for the price compared to others like boat/Sony/jbl1)Battery life of 7 hours is a HOAX. Still,I expected at least 3-4 hours backup & even that also I am not getting! Battery drains like anything, 20% drop in 5 minutes. So, in 25 minutes, battery is 0% from 100%! Even when switched off, it doesnt retain the battery for a day.Ridiculous product. Maybe I got a defective battery. Have asked for return.2)Bluetooth range is DISAPPOINTING! even when I turn my head a bit, there are connection drops! Certainly not on par with any 5.0 Bluetooth device. Very unsteady connection with frequent connection breaks.3) Sound quality is below average. Bass is almost nonexistent. Vocals aren't clear enough. My boat wired headphone gives 100 times better quality.4) Uncomfortable for day to day usage. Can't bear it for more than 30 min. Ears start paining. And I feel like brain fog after removing them with aching head.5) Gets dirty very soon. The rubber part attracts lots and lots of dust.6) person next to you hears everything you are hearing,which is very irritating.

Good quality wireless Earphones from Mivi.
",5 January 2020,"
Hey everyone so I have been using this wireless earphones for more than a 3 days now and here is my review.->Packing and Box Contents:- It comes in a Grey and yellow coloured box with Mivi branding. Inside the box you will get the following contents:- * Earphones* Few extra ear tips* USB cable for charging* User manual & Warranty card->Build Quality:- The quality of the this is nice and the finishing is also perfect as it is made up of metalic body and it looks premium. Now coming to the earphones it is also made up of plastic with magnetic housing which makes it little bit heavy but quality of the earphones are great.->Audio Quality:- The audio output is great and the bass is also perfect, volume is so loud and clear.-With the help of the inline microphone you can also take calls with these earphones and while calling there were no issues and there is delay in audio while playing games. It works perfectly while listening to music and for movies.->Battery Backup:- it's having 120mAh battery which will last for a longer period of time approx 6-7 hours. * It comes with Bluetooth 5.0 which gives a faster connection you can also use it over longer range upto 10 meters. ->Verdict:- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for less than ₹1500 then you can definitely go for this earphones as the audio quality is perfect and the bass is also great in this earphones.->It is IPX4 certified, splash proof and the ergonomic design gives a great fitting which is great for workouts or jogging. Thank you for reading my review.

I have mentioned its pros and cons..what is good and what is bad👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
",27 December 2019,"
Reason why i m returning this earphone:-1. Its mirophone is very less sensitive even compared with a  samsung earphone which come free with a phone..U cant talk to someone in whispering sound even putting the mic on ur lips...it's good for u if u donot need to do so.2. Bluetooth range is very poor...it start disconnecting only if u reach a separation of less than 10meter from ur phone..i couldn't listen the music even if i go to the bathrm and let the phone in room which is a very less distance..3. Everytime when u long press mfb to power off ur  headphone it activates google assistant on ur phone because the system is that if u press the powere button for three sec it will power off and if for two sec, it will activate google assistant4. it gives a very annoying and loud sound in ur ear saying:-""power off and power on"" every time when u off or on it..these sounds will be very loud even if u turn of ur volume to least..What i found worthy in this are:-1. Sound quality was very good as compared to those earphone which comes free with ur phone and also i have use wired eps of samsung and mi of ₹750 and ₹550 respectively before this but its sound quality is far better than any of them..it gave me a very different experience of listing music..bass is also fine2. Its connectivity speed is very fast..as soon as u power on it it will get connected to ur phone..3. Its multi-function button is useful as u can do various things with this such as connecting two devices at a time, u can recieve a call, u can ignore a call, u can mute a call, u can disconnect a call and even u can dial the last called number on ur phone from the same button..4. I am returning this onlh in one time use although i can comment on this part because as much as i have used it, its battery is still 100% so i think its battery backup is also very good but i have not tested the charging part that how much time it takes to fully charge and fully discharge..Conclusion:- u should buy this if u neednot to talk to ur GF or BF in whispering sound..😊And u r comfortable carring ur phone in pocket always when u use ur headphone.Hope my time spent on this review comes helpful to u🙃

very Harmful to ears
",16 January 2020,"
I had to do tough work to wear it into my ears. After wearing it into ears within a minute, it started hurting. So I qould say it is hazardous for ears. Although sound quality is right, you should not buy this product. You can get a similar variety of sounds with other earphones too, with good fit quality and less price.

Post purchase services is bad and thus should imporve
",5 October 2019,"
I had made a complaint to you through the MIVI website but there was no response so i think here you could pay some attention. However the issue is that the volume button of the product isn't working at all. And thus it is creating issues in connecting as well as playing any audio. I can't use it for anything. Kindly look into the matter ASAP.

Bang for your buck. Must buy!
",26 January 2020,"
I have been using it from last 2 days. I am going to divide my experience into pros and cons.🙂Pros.1) Excellent build quality .Body of Earphones are made up of metal and finished properly. Wires are flat and tangle free. They are build to last. These are also IPx4 certified.🙂2) battery backup is decent. I have been hearing it at around 60-70% volume from last 5 hrs. Still 15-20% of charge is left.3) sound quality is very good.This will suit bass-heads better.Bass is punchy. Vocals are crisp.Highs could have been a bit better.(Note: These are extremely loud. Not recommended to use it above 80% volume.)4) despite of having Passive noice cancellation or CVC by Qualcomm.These do a pretty good job of cutting the ambient noise.🤩5) These are extremely comfortable to wear. They fit in ear properly.6) Bluetooth 5.0 gives an excellent range of 30 feet as per claimed by mivi. Yet to be tested. My phone too supports Bt 5.0. will further update it.🤔Cons.1) After a certain volume to be precise 80%, the highs and mids get muffled.Bass gets overpowering and a bit distorted.2)if I will nitpick 😅, It's uncomfortable to wear after usage of 1.5 hour.

Noise Cancellation at 1399 is a steal Deal
",20 January 2020,"
Noise Cancellation @1399 is amazing deal anytime. This mivi thunderbeats come with Qualcomm cvc technology which reduces ambient noise and provides a very good experience.Build Quality:It's great to see such robust build quality at this price point. Buttons are sturdy and tactile. Flat wire with rubberised coating makes it good.Design:Design is modern and increases your style quotient. Metal finishes put these apart.Sound:Bass dominant tuning of these earphones make it best choice for bass lovers.

Picks up everything around apart from the speaker
",17 January 2020,"
Hi, I bought this product when it was brought under light by mumbaiker nikhil about a year or so ago. I believed his reviews to be so true as he is a very out spoken person about his feelings towards a product or anything for that nature however he did not let us know that the mic on this headset picks up everything around you and amplifies the same. Now when someone is talking to me they always complain stating that the background sound(road traffic honks or any other noise is alot and they hear me way less.The is zero to no noise cancellation on this in fact it will do its best to amplify the noise coming from the background which I hate.The only downside to these headsets is the background noise that it picks up, using it at home or a quiet place the product outshines.In case they come out with new iterations I request them to work on the background noise/noise cancellation!!Good day!

As per my knowledge & hearing experience after using this product I can say following things : Pros - Bass part is just superb,noise cancellation is phenomenal,Lower end of sound is also very nice,voice & lyrics clarity simply awesome. Cons - Bluetooth connectivity is also good but not the best as it sometimes after connected wid my phone getting automatically disconnected & the mid part/range or treble part of sound muffled a bit..If Mivi can increase the treble 2/3 steps further then it wd be the best brand so far in hearing industry.Thank you hope Mivi will listen & fix this in their upcoming products..Last but not the least I'm really enjoying the product.

Receieved the product today, quality is good, connected to my phone easily with no issues. Sound quality is good.Noise cancellation is good. Bass is just ok nothing that great to boost about. There was only one problem faced and that is not with th product itself but with the charging cable provided inside witht he product. i had connected the headphone for charging and left it for 2hours it did not charge. Later i used some other cable and it started charging and charged within 30 mins to full charge. So in my case the charging cable is faulty that was provided within the box. Rest will update once i use them for a month or more.

Bad for heavy-bass, hearing a sharp irritating sound whenever it comes to songs with Bass.
",25 January 2020,"
Honest review - The build quality is fantastic. Their comfort level is average while wearing at home or running. Battery life is also good, but if you listen to heavy bass songs (as I do) they're not good at all. I listen to Kendrick Lamar, Logic and other artists, their songs have got heavy bass, I listened to them on these and now I continuously hear a very sharp irritating vibrating voice from both earbuds, I'm returning this product.They're great if you listen to normal classical music which DONT have heavy bass. Otherwise its not good.

Awesome & Value For Money Product
",21 January 2020,"
Mivi now came up with range of Bluetooth headsets of which Mivi Thunderbeats is the most popular under their segment. It is priced for about Rs. 1,199/- and its worth spending.The packaging of Mivi Thunderbeats is large, as it includes not only the headset but also a case to store the headset..Complete Review.➡️ Product material : Use of metal for caps and plastic in construction ( metal caps because it has magnets in it so that one can snap it together for avoiding dangling and falling of the headset ).➡️ Mivi Thunderbeats is an in-ear canalphone-style pair of Bluetooth headphones..➡️ It has - three buttons - a microphone - an LED light - a Micro-USB port for charging..➡️ The headset fits well in the medium size ears and the hooks keep it firm for not falling. Tested it while running, its just firm and due to its noise cancellation it is a good choice for sure..➡️ It last for about 6-7 hrs on a full charge. And charges also very quickly.Noise Cancellation : 4 🌟Sound Quality : 5 🌟Bluetooth Connectivity : 5 🌟For full Video search on YouTube WiFi Tech.🙂

Pain to ears but a good budget wireless earphone
",24 January 2020,"
Using it for almost a month now. Excellent noise cancellation plus it's a good earphone for all those who like to hear bass. Moreover it does perform better than other budget wireless earphones in terms of phone call answering. The receiver was able to listen what I spoke and I was fine with it. Areas were the working of earphones surprised me:1. While turning my head or while keeping my phone behind me during exercise bit seemed that the earphone lost connection. Albeit be it was a temporary pause it was eerie.2. The range is a real issue .3. The pads provided for better griping with ears. I don't know from which material these are made of but these are a real pain to my ears after wearing it for more than 20 mins.

Hello friends i purchased this product everything seems to be nice when i paired firstly with my laptop it works but again (after offing headset)when i switched my headset on it connects automatically because it was paired before successfully now it started to cut sounds in between like-:""who are you you are fantastic""in the above line it cutted ""are"" i feel something wrong in pairing so i removed the device and paired it again now the problem is solved but to check i again turned off headset when i switch it on the problem persists again it is cutting sound same with an android mobile also so if you have to use this you have to pair again & again every time you switch off. All rest things are damn cool but i doubt that after some time the mivi logo will look weard due to rear and tear i am returning this item now.

Mivi thunderbeats Bluetooth headphonesphone user review
",20 January 2020,"
Mivi Thunderbeats Bluetooth Earphone is one such Bluetooth headset offered by India’s homegrown brand Mivi. It is the company’s top of the line earphone boasting top-notch specs. Well, getting swayed by just looking at the specs-sheet often doesn’t end well. So, let’s see how good this earphone is in real life.Design-wise, the Mivi Thunderbeats earphone comes with a metallic finish and a well-built body. The earphone looks premium, and the texture feels good too.The company has put in a lot of effort to provide an ergonomic design for this earphone, and it did so quite successfully. In addition to multiple sized ear buds, the Thunderbeats also feature ear hooks to keep them tightly fitted into your ear. I must say, these ear hooks really help the earphone fit well. I would also like to explicitly point out that “the earphone fits well” doesn’t necessarily mean “the earphone is comfortable”.Mivi has also thrown in the magnetic locks to keep the earphone in place. Brownie points to Mivi for that. These magnetic locks really come in handy and help the earphone from falling while not in use. But that comes at the cost of extra weight. The earphone is too heavy for my liking. And that makes them uncomfortable to use for a long time. The Thunderbeats also features a pretty much tangle-free cord with an adjustable clip to alter the length.Mivi ThunderbeatsThe battery backup of the earphone is just plain awesome. It did last more than 5 hours of continuous music playback. If not paired to any device, the earphone shuts down automatically to save battery. Pairing to any device is also a fairly easy task to do. It comes with three functional buttons comprising volume up, down and a multifunction key. However, pairing to a new device when it is already paired to one was a bit irritating. We had to shut the Bluetooth off from the paired device to connect it to the new device. You can also connect two devices at the same time, given that the devices are already paired with the earphone.Coming to the performance part, the Mivi Thunderbeats earphone is backed with Qualcomm CSR8645 chip featuring Bluetooth V4.1 and aptX Bluetooth code. The aptX code is a next generation audio codec which promises to offer enhanced wireless sound quality. But for that, you need an aptX supported headset as well as a smartphone. And, as of now, there are only handful of devices which includes aptX support.Apart from that, the Thunderbeats earphone doesn’t disappoint us in terms of sound quality. It is capable of offering deep bass but lacks a bit on mids. It’s a pleasure for bass lovers, but don’t expect much on higher volumes. The bass tends to crack up, and signal-to-noise takes a dip at such levels. There’s just too much shrill to handle, especially if you listen to any of Sia’s songs.If I compare the Thunderbeats with my OnePlus V2 Bullets, I would say both the devices are on par with each other. Thunderbeats would beat Bullets in bass, but OnePlus offers much better mids and overall instrumental sound. The V2 Bullets are also far more comfortable than that Thunderbeats. So, it’s a matter of personal choice which one would you pick.Overall, the Mivi Thunderbeats is one good choice for a budget wireless earphone. The earphone offers a great design with magnetic locks, aptX Bluetooth transmission technology and superior battery life. If you’re someone who digs high bass, the Thunderbeats won’t disappoint you considering the price point (Rs 1,399).

 ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️As you can see in the video, the battery % is automatically changing.Also the battery % is dropping down by 20-20 % like 100 to 80 to 60 to 40 & 20% (it's like this only or just I'm facing - plz reply)No 30 feet range as mentioned. In an open place like ground etc. the range is around 18-20 feet. & At home you won't get even 10 feet range properly in case if any wall comes in between.Sometimes Lagging in sound while playing songs/videos online & even offline. No notification sound or sound coming late when earphones connected. Rare connectivity issue too over call sometimes.🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂Design & material quality is good & If you're not using there's a Magnet for safety.Bass lovers gonna love this. Mids and highs are fair enough too & overall sound quality & volume is great.Noise cancellation & fade in sound feature is awesome. Fitting is fine too.

Value For Money Wireless Bluetooth headphone
",18 January 2020,"
I got these ThunderBeats for Rs.1299, At this price point these are the best wireless earphones you can go for.*Gave me about 6-7 hours of battery backup when used at volume levels less than 75% and I should say these are pretty loud earphones, so definitely you never going to listen to music at 100% volume for long time.*These connect very quickly to your device, thanks for Bluetooth 5.0 it really makes difference*Range is about 10-15 feet when the devices are at line of sight. When you are indoor it works seamlessly if you are in next room but if there are 2 walls in between the source and earphones it starts breaking.*I like the Design and built quality of ThunderBeats*I have been using for a week in the gymI will definitely recommend these earphones at this price point.Thank you Mivi.

To be honest, I'm impressed
",18 January 2020,"
Well to be honest the Audio quality from this earphone is worth for the price, i felt like it is durable because they used flat cables,when we comes to noise cancellation, they gave passive noise cancellation which helps me a lot when I'm in a call with someone, it eliminates the noise around me, that's so good..and the best thing which impressed me is the magnetic locking system.. In this price segment noone is giving it..that's also a great advantage, the only negative point about the earphone is the size,otherwise they didn't compromise in audioquality, noise cancellation and aswell as bluetooth connectivity,it takes only 3 sec when i connected with my phone for the first time, that's great.Thanks to mivi for giving this awesome product at affordable cost✌

This product is ine of the best sound quality product in the market, but sound is not the only parameter for ratings. One of the worst thing about this earphones is its design. I have bought this for running and skipping purposes but these earphones don't hang inside ears once you start to jump or run. One of the side where buttons are placed is elongated and results in lose ear contact. Apart form this single thing this earphones rock. Build quality is superior, sound is superior and even battery backup is also superior. But do check for options if buying this for workout purpose.

The bass on this headset is bizarrely amazing and that proves to be the selling point of this device.if you're a basshead this is a treat to your ears. it's my first day using it so can't really talk about the durability and how long it would last...but by the looks of it, it looks robust.A minor con i had was the fitting as many people have had issues but I changed the buds and it fit me just fine.bluetooth connection is good but if you move another room with a wall between, the connection will shrivel.overall a great package given that I got it for just 899 bucks.

Excellent performance
",23 January 2020,"
Excellent Bass Quality and Noise cancellation Makes it very worthy!The overall quality of the earphone is very nice, the ear buds are very soft and does not give irritation feeling as such!With Constant use, battery lasts long for around 7-8 hours which is more than sufficient if you are a moderate user.Overall quite happy with the product.

Best at it's price -  Trust me.
",29 December 2019,"
Product is good, and I am really enjoying it. Great Bass, but low Treble. Plugs are heavy bcz of metalic design, so not good for long usage. Max 1 hour usage is fine, but wearing it longer starts paining in ear.Overall nice product from MiVi at this price.

Mivi thunder you get my every day ...
",22 January 2020,"
First thing I would to talk about its noise cancellation is damn good and it's bass of beats every song I clearly listen ... That after i never expected as such noise cancellation in Bluetooth headset first ever it's excellent in doing exercises and running activities or but you have to very care about to go on road with these. .. trust me it's noise cancellation is damn good it's cause you an accident if you try on roadside walking ..  be careful by own ... Safety first

Good to buy on low budget.  Cannot be used on regular basis.
",21 October 2019,"
I tried buying this from a long time.  Once I got it it was good to use.Pros:Good bassGood battery lifeGood noice cancellation.Cons:This con is a very big con.  Because the earphone is heavy and cannot be wear for a long time. I don't like it's placement on ears.  Very big once.  While seeing image I thought it would be small.  But it's very big. I am not using it though due to that.

Great product but fragile overall
",11 January 2020,"
Pros:Power packed battery ; works fine for 7 hours and charging time around 1 hour .Fits in the ear perfectly and gives perfect noise cancellation.Bass is good .Cons:Device sometimes get disconnected automatically for calls while is still playing.Plastic cover used to protect the usb charging port breaks after certain usageSweat Resistance not upto the mark can cause short circuit  (has been the case with many people i know;replacement is done till warranty period).Replacement procedure is quite lengthy.

Good earphones
",14 December 2019,"
Build Quality: The earphones are cased in metal, have flat tangle-free wires & very good quality ear tips and earfins. So, for the price, the build great. Rough usage won't be a problem as well.Sound quality: The bass is really punchy. If you like EDMs, you'll love these earphones. The mids felt a little muffled and the treble could've been just a bit better.Comfort: The earbuds feel a little heavy because of the metal casing, so comfort is compromised a bit. Although you can wear it for an hour or so without any worries.

Only 1 star For its Style. Looks like Big earrings!
",9 October 2019,"
If you think that you will go outside wearing this headsets, throw away that thoughts because the earplugs are too big than other products available in market. They seems like you have wear the big ear-rings in your ears and you will feel shamed by going in public.If you only want to use as hearing quality music and any audio then only I recommend this but in style It receives only 1 STAR. You will not get any hard kind of band round the neck so possibly it can get out of your ears too easily. So overall I give it max 3 STARS.

The MIVI Bluetooth headphones are value for money. They have great battery life and durability. It was recommended to me by my cousin, he used it for over a year and it is still working great.Overall quality is great and I recommend everyone to buy them. They are packed with bass. I have to keep one of my ear open so that I can hear the outside  world. It is so tightly packed I feel like I am in a concert.Overall, nice product, great durability and value for money. 👍👍

Mivi is a big disappointment
",28 January 2020,"
Got them delivered and tried to switch them on and they did not work i thought the battery must be dead but when i tried switching it on after charging it, still won't switch on. I am disappointed with MIVI this is the second time this happened, i spent almost about 2.5 K on duopods and they started giving me issues in less than a month into the usage. I would suggest you add a couple of hundred bucks and go for JBL or sony if you want wirless and if you want wired then under 2 k you can get some of the best ones

Such a silly mistake

As you can see in the photo, they've given both left sided rubber grips. Didn't expect this. I've bought the same mivi headset from mivi web page and there wasn't any issue. I've been using it since 14-15 days, the only issue I'm facing is mic problem. While on call the other can't hear my voice. He'll feel like I'm talking from somewhere far n low voice output. Rest all is fine but I bought this headset only for calls. And this mic problem is really dissatisfying.

Overall review
",16 January 2020,"
Sound quality is also very good, the fit is also amazing, they don't fall out easily and fit into the ears easily. Everything is great in this product, but the thing that you should improve is that make them lightweight they are not very light, sometimes it feels bulky. The battery life is very good and the build quality is also great.

Not at all good, sharing experience of one year
",27 September 2019,"
I bought this headphones one year ago, first of all the buds are really heavy you will feel pain on ears for the first few days, sound clarity was good, but in 2 weeks one bud stop working, I contacted the customer care and they asked me to send the headphones, after verifying they replaced the headphone saying it got some issues. New piece has been replaced for me, but the replaced headphone also stooped  working after few months, again they replaced new, now that it stopped working and the warranty period is over. Think before spending money, read all the reviews and go for it. I found most of the reviews here are of one or two weeks of usage, this is a honest review of one year experience.

People's who are buying without case model be aware..
",14 October 2019,"
People's who are buying without case model be aware that model doesn't comes with aptx, which was sadly a deal breaker for me.Rs 999 model have some minor cost cutting here and there like no aptx, only qualcomm cvc instead of cvc6.0 . It just sound like ordinary 999 wireless earphones comming from other brands like iball  Boat . I think its cheating by the seller to sell other model in the name and description of a popular model like mivi Thunderbeats. I will post the picture for both models boxes

READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY.
",23 January 2020,"
These are by far the best Bluetooth earphones you can buy under Rs.1500I have used the boat 261 before buying this so I'll be comparing both of them as they are the two best Bluetooth earphones in the price range.In terms of overall sound the thunderbeats are pretty damnn good. The Bass and trebel is good. Even the vocals are well balanced.Compared to the boat 261, I would say that both are neck to neck with the slight edge to Mivi.In terms of the overall build quality, I would say that Mivi is miles ahead. The metallic build gives a more premium look and feel. And the cable is quite durable too.The boat 261 looks good too but is made up of plastic, so it doesn't feel as premium.Also I love the magnets on the mivi thunderbeats. They are quite helpful in case you are not using the earphones. The boat 261 lacks this. Both are IP certified.Apart from this, the battery life is pretty good on both of them. No issues regarding that.The Bluetooth range is good but walls can hinder it as it does in all the Bluetooth earphones that I've used. The good thing is that it has Bluetooth 5.0 so f you have a phone with Bluetooth 5.0 the range will be even better.Also the warranty registration and redemption is pretty seamless with mivi.The only thing that I didn't like about these earphones is that they don't come with a case. Everything else is just fantastic.I would definitely recommend buying these if you are looking for Bluetooth earphones under 1500 rs. I got it for 899 plus some cashback in the Great Indian Sale and for that price they are a steal.

One of the best reliable bluetooth earphones in market
",13 October 2019,"
I have ordered this product twice till now, lost the first one. First impressions: Great build quality, gives you a premium feeling. One of the mivi representative contacted frw days after delivery to take feedback on the product. Bluetooth connectivity works great. Automatically disconnects to save power if you don't use it for sometime. Have been using it for almost a year now. Recommend this product to few of my friends and all of them who purchased are happy with the product. All in all a very good product.Only con i feel is this will not be suitable for people who wish to use while riding bikes as the ear pieces are little bulky and hence with a helmet you will feel the earpaining badly.

DON'T BUY... I REPEAT DON'T BUY
",11 December 2019,"
 Worst headphones ever. After few weeks of using, the sounds quality goes so bad that even putting both ears headphones, u need to cover it with your hands in order to listen it.Have got it replaced 3 times & still the same issues.Got the new one & now they fail to connect.I'm asking for a refund or credit note which too the company fails to give me.Bigger bigger companies give either a credit or a code in which you buy a different product from the their website but these Mivi support is........... Don't want to say anything now.JUST DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.

Do not buy at any condition, worst earphones, total waste of money
",16 December 2019,"
It's highly recommended not to buy this product. Worst earphones to date. Feels very heavy on ears. Ears would pain after 1 hour of continuous listening. Stopped working after using it in the first workout. MIVI claims it is sweatproof but at the time of complaining they would start giving a useless explanation of what sweatproof means and terms and condition. You can buy Boat Rokerzz 225 instead far better than this.

",28 January 2020,"
The earphones are awesome for 7/10 days, until it shows its true colours, (i.e) it stops working anytime anywhere, the bass & sound clarity is superb but if doesn't turn on what's the use of it.I have exchanged the product twice & then finally returned it, that too within a span of 15 days. How can a company be so careless with their products, which Claims to give 1 year warranty, where the earphones don't even work for a month, thanks to amazon & their services that i can exchange & return the product or else it would had been a ""waste of money"".If you (MIVI) is willing to give good quality & bass guarantee (which they do provide) but not durability, then what's the use of all the advertisement & promotion through influencers & social media, what can one get out of a dead earphone which won't even turn on for the consumer to realise how good the product is.Sound :- 4 starBass :- 5 starConnectivity :- 4 starDurability :- 1 star (just fir name sake).

Pathetic Service Response
",4 December 2019,"
Thunderbeats which i had bought a few days back, as the manufacturer clain to have atleast 7hours of playback (at 70%volume level) is coming upto less than 4 hours at 50%volume level. And once the charge drops from 100%, the audio becomes choot till the battery dies off.On the box it is mentioned BEST IN INDUSTRY manufacturer warranty, when contacted they're not all responding to this.Very pathetic response and please don't buy this headsets, it's a waste of time and money.

Pathetic product. Primary and replaced one both !
",27 December 2019,"
I had purchased this product after looking at the specifications. I basically wanted a earphone for my running. Firstly the product I got stopped working in 7 days which got replaced after many follow ups. The moment I got the replaced product it worked well for couple of days and then rest is history.The problem with this earphone is that it never worked!! Makes your ears pain and doesn't last too long !

Would surely suggest it.
",17 December 2019,"
Pros.Bass- GoodTreble- goodMid riffs are just perfect.Battery- Excellent ( 6-7 hrs)Build quality- great.Cons.Build quality is so good, but kinda makes it heavy so ears get painful after long usage.As the controller unit is on a single side so the Earphone's wire tend to lean towards that side making it heavier.Overall ratings: 8 out 10 (Genre wise)10 out of 10 (price wise)Would recommend using it being a frequent user of earphones.

Good quality but ear buds are quite lose and fall off easily.
",25 September 2019,"
Good quality headphones and easy to carry with and without the case.But the Bluetooth quality deteriorates when you use multiple apps simultaneously. For example, PUBG and Discord.Also, the buds that come along with the earphones which are changeable according to the ear size and very very lose and can fall off anytime if you remove it from your bag, pocket or even ears at times.

Not that good
",3 October 2019,"
See at first they seemed to be good but as you start to use them for long they become very uncomfortable. Even the durability is not that great. I purchased them a year ago and the Bluetooth module's cover worn out. I know you guys heard about them from your favourite but know I thing... They are biased. They get paid to do these reviews.I would not recommend going for these under any circumstance.

Poor battery life
",25 October 2019,"
These are nothing but just some another cheap Chinese earphone branded under Indian company.After 3 months battery life has dropped to 4 hours max from 6 hours in the beginning months.The eartips provided are so cheap and of local quality that most of the time it came off on its own and even sometime remain in my ears.But at last sound quality is good as compared to the price point.
